= LangGraph Basics Examples

This directory contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating basic LangGraph concepts through progressively complex examples.

== Overview

The notebook `langgraph_basics.ipynb` implements several examples that showcase how to build stateful agent workflows using LangGraph. Each example builds upon the previous one, introducing new concepts and patterns.

== Examples

=== 1. Minimal Hello World

The first example demonstrates the most basic LangGraph workflow:

* **State Schema**: Defines an `AgentState` TypedDict with:
  - `user_name`: The user's name
  - `output`: A list of output messages
* **Node**: A single `greeting_node` that greets the user
* **Graph Structure**: Simple linear flow: START → greeting → END
* **Usage**: Takes a pre-provided user name and generates a greeting

=== 2. Extended Flow with User Input

This example extends the basic flow by adding user interaction:

* **New Node**: `ask_user_name` node that prompts the user for their name via console input
* **Graph Structure**: START → ask_user_name → greeting → END
* **Usage**: The application now asks for the user's name before greeting them

=== 3. Conditional Logic: Ask for Name Only If Unknown

Introduces conditional routing based on state:

* **Conditional Edge**: A `should_ask_user_name` function that determines the next node based on whether the user name is already known
* **Graph Structure**: 
  - START conditionally routes to either `ask_user_name` or `greeting`
  - If name is unknown → ask_user_name → greeting → END
  - If name is known → greeting → END
* **Usage**: The application intelligently skips asking for the name if it's already provided in the initial state

=== 4. Looping: Greet Multiple Persons

Demonstrates how to create loops in the graph:

* **New Conditional Node**: `ask_for_more_users` that prompts whether to add another user
* **Graph Structure**: 
  - START conditionally routes based on whether name is known
  - After greeting, conditionally loops back to ask for another user or ends
  - Creates a cycle: greeting → ask_for_more_users → (loop back to ask_user_name or END)
* **Usage**: Allows greeting multiple users in sequence, with the option to continue or stop after each greeting

== Key Concepts Demonstrated

* **State Management**: Using TypedDict to define the agent's state schema
* **Node Definition**: Creating functions that modify state
* **Graph Construction**: Building graphs with `StateGraph`
* **Conditional Edges**: Routing based on state conditions
* **Loops**: Creating cycles in the graph for iterative workflows
* **Visualization**: Using Mermaid diagrams to visualize graph structure

== Dependencies

The notebook requires:

* `langgraph` - For building stateful agent workflows
* `IPython` - For displaying graph visualizations
* Python standard library modules: `typing`, `pprint`, `logging`

== Usage

Open the Jupyter notebook `langgraph_basics.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially. Each example section can be run independently, though later examples build upon earlier concepts.
