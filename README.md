# LangGraph Examples

This repository is dedicated for collecting applications examples built with LangGraph (mostly chatbots and dialogue agents).

## What is [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/)

LangGraph is a library to build dialogue systems. In general, it operates as a [Finite State Machine (FSM)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-62533-1_4#Sec1).

In other words, a dialogue is modeled wtih:
* A list of nodes (e.g. entry node, greeting node, order node)
* A list of edges: transitions between the nodes (can also be conditional)
* A dialogue state: a dictionary with slots that are to be filled within a dialogue (e.g. client address when ordering a pizza)

**Important:** Don't mix up an "FSM State" (a node) and a "Dialogue State" (a collection of [slots](https://paperswithcode.com/task/slot-filling/latest#:~:text=The%20goal%20of,the%20target%20entity.) to be filled).
